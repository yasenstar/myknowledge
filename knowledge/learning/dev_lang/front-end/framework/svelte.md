# svelte - Cybernetically Enhanced Web Apps

Weblink: https://svelte.dev/

## Key objectives

- Write less code: build biolerplate-free components using languages you already know - [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]]
- No virtual DOM: svelte compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS - your app starts fast and stays fast
- Truly reactive: no more complex state management libraries - svelte brings reactivity to JavaScript itseft
